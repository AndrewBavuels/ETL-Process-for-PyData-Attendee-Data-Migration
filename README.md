# Enter the New World of PyData Madrid 🐍

ETL Process for PyData Attendee Data Migration by Andrew Bavuels

## Project Description 👇

This project automates the migration of attendee data from Meetup to Guild, ensuring a smooth transition for PyData Madrid events. It includes a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline to clean, standardize, and merge registration data from both platforms while handling inconsistencies such as duplicate registrations, missing fields, and typos.

> **_Disclaimer:_** The original CSV files containing attendee data are not included in this repository due to confidentiality reasons. However, the code is fully functional and can be adapted to process similar datasets, allowing users to merge attendee lists from two different platforms.

The project is structured as follows:

```sh
.
├── README.md
├── environment.yml
├── merge_lists.py
├── pixi.lock
└── pyproject.toml
```

## Project Structure

- `merge_lists.py`: A **Python** script responsible for merging attendee lists from **Meetup** and **Guild**, ensuring consistency and avoiding duplicates.

- `pixi.lock`: Lock file generated by Pixi to ensure consistent environment setup.

- `pydata_env.yml`: YAML file specifying the environment and dependencies for Conda users.

- `pyproject.toml`: Configuration file for Pixi, listing the project dependencies. [Click here for  Pixi documentation.](https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/pyproject_toml/)

## Installation ⚙️

To set up the environment, use one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Conda

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Option 2: Pixi

Ensure pixi is installed:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
pixi sync
pixi run pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install missing pip dependencies
```

## Libraries in the virtual environment and the Python Script 💻

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html): Data manipulation and analysis.
- [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html): Command-line parsing.
- [Unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/): Converts text with special characters (like accents) into plain ASCII characters.

## Run

To generate `attendees.csv`, run the ETL script with the following command **in the terminal:**

### Running with Conda

```sh
python merge_lists.py --guild event-attendee-export.csv --meetup _Embeddings_para_contratacin_financiera_Redes_neuronales_de_grafos.csv --output attendees.csv
```

### Running with Pixi

```sh
pixi run python merge_lists.py --guild event-attendee-export.csv --meetup _Embeddings_para_contratacin_financiera_Redes_neuronales_de_grafos.csv --output attendees.csv
```

The `attendees.csv` is the final **ETL** output file containing the consolidated attendee list with relevant attributes. **It will be generated in the repo root directory.**
